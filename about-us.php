            <p>Deep Power is developing XDrill<sup>TM</sup>, a breakthrough geothermal drilling technology to access the Earth’s unlimited source of clean heat energy, which can be used to produce unlimited, low-cost green electricity anywhere in the world. <br><br>The Earth’s molten core is as hot as the Sun and harnessing just 0.1% of that heat energy can power humanity for 2 million years. Previous generations of drilling technology cannot go deep enough to make geothermal cost effective. We are developing XDrill<sup>TM</sup> to boldly go where no humans have gone before. The deeper we go the more energy we can unleash. <br><br>Unlike large area solar and wind farms, a 9-inch hole by 5 miles deep can produce the same amount of power as 320 acres of solar panels. Like a power plug into the Earth, we aim to provide every city, state, and country direct and independent access to this “holy grail” source of eternal green energy. </p>

            <!-- <p>The Earth’s molten core is as hot as the Sun as evidenced by the
                eruption of volcanos and geysers such as Old Faithful in Yellowstone
                National Park. Harnessing just 0.1% of that heat energy can power
                humanity for 2 million years. <br><br>
                Current state-of-the-art drilling technology cannot drill deep enough
                to make geothermal cost effective at a global scale. We are
                developing a suite of breakthrough drilling technologies to boldly go
                where no humans have gone before. The deeper we go the more
                heat energy we can unleash.<br><br>
                Unlike large area solar and wind farms, a 9-inch hole drilled 5 miles
                deep can produce the same amount of power as 320 acres of solar
                panels. By plugging into this power deep within the Earth, we aim to
                provide direct access to an unlimited source of constant heat energy
                which can be used to produce low-cost green electricity anywhere in
                the world </p> -->
