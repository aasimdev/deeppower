                  <li>
                  Geothermal plants release less than one-tenth of the carbon dioxide emissions compared to a fossil fuel plant

                  <li>
                  Capital costs are lower for Geothermal plants than similar sized Nuclear or Fossil fuel plants. Also as the source of energy already exists there are no fuel costs (unlike Nuclear and fossil.)

                  <li>
                  It is abundant and available 24 hrs a day – unlike wind and solar energy!

Consider that putting a room-temperature rock into boiling water transfers to it an equivalent amount of energy as would hurling it to a super-sonic speed! We characterize the amount of heat an object can hold by its specific heat capacity, in Joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (or Kelvin, since one degree of change is the same in either system). Tying some energy concepts together, the definition of a kilocalorie (4184 J) is the amount of energy it takes to raise 1 kg (1 liter) of water 1Â°C. So we can read the specific heat capacity straight away as 4184 J/kg/K. This is a rather large heat capacity, on the scale of things. As a rule of thumb, 1000 J/kg/K is a marvelously convenient universal number for most substances: it works for wood, air, rock, etc. Liquids tend to be higher (typ. 2000 J/kg/K), and metals tend to be lower (150â€“500 J/kg/K). Rocksâ€”relevant for geothermal energyâ€”range from about 700â€“1100 J/kg/K, and although I would be happy enough to use the convenient 1000 J/kg/K for crude analysis, I will be somewhat more refined and use 900 J/kg/K for rock in this postâ€”although I feel silly for it.

The annual event is organized by the Geothermal Energy Association (GEA), the “oldest geothermal association on Earth.” <br /> <br /> It is one of the few events where professionals and members of the public from the global geothermal community can come together to share their latest findings and developments, share analysis results and how those results apply to real-world problems. This year’s conference was no exception, with representatives from Mexico, Chili, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and India in attendance. <br /> <br /> The conference featured a variety of panels and presentations on different aspects of geothermal energy, from drilling and exploration to power generation and environmental impact. Other presentations highlighted new technologies for capturing geothermal energy and developing geothermal projects.<p>"

                "<p><span>Corrosion of Materials Used in Geothermal Wells</span> <br /> One of the most important topics of discussion at this year’s GRC was corrosion of materials and components of geothermal power plants. According to several papers presented by Sigrún Nanna Karlsdóttir, Ph.D., Professor of Industrial Eng., Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Iceland, this issue has been a major concern for the industry in recent years, as scaling can lead to significant losses in efficiency and lifespan for geothermal wells. <br /> <br /> The corrosion of common metallic construction materials such as carbon steel is a serious technical challenge in geothermal power production. Large quantities of geothermal water in the wells can easily corrode metals and other materials. This leads to decreased efficiency and reliability in the plant. Additionally, corrosion can be costly to treat and can generate unwanted products.<p>"

                "<p><span>The Problem</span> <br />The corrosion of pipes in geothermal plants leads to efficiency loss and system failure. In the geothermal industry, it is crucial to keep the corrosion rate below 0.1 mm/year to maintain the average 20-year life span of a power generating system. <br /> <br /> Corrosion levels depend on geological and environmental conditions and aspects of geothermal processing such as hydrogeochemistry, reservoir depth, the temperature and pressure in the wells, flow rate, operating parameters, and other factors. <br /> <br /> Geothermal corrosion can cause significant damage to power plants, leading to costly repairs and interruptions in production. Moreover, an unexpected shutdown can result in severe economic consequences. According to an article in Advances in anti-scale magnetic water treatment on scaling, an estimated $27 billion each year is lost due to scale formation in the geothermal sector across the world.<p>"

                "<p><span>Fundamental Solutions</span> <br />Economic considerations concerning possible replacements of components that are in contact with the processed brine are one of the biggest challenges, and different companies are addressing the problem in different ways. Some are using new materials that are more resistant to corrosion, while others are taking a more proactive approach and using coatings to protect the well from damage. In addition, several cost-effective chemical and organic coatings are being tested and perfected.
                <br /> <br /> We saw several compelling solutions presented by Professor Sigrún Nanna Karlsdóttir, Ph.D, from iron boride coatings to nanobubbles. Below are two of the most widely used solutions discussed at GRC.
                <br /> <br /> Corrosion-resistant Construction Materials: Well-selected low-cost corrosion-resistant materials can help present an alternative to carbon steel. Proper corrosion engineering can also play a role in ensuring that these facilities are as reliable as possible. However, despite the high cost, some expensive high quality, high-reliability materials are necessary for performance and safety reasons.
                <br /> <br /> Corrosion Resistant Coatings: Low-cost carbon steel protective coatings can be an effective engineering technique. Many coatings and technologies exist, including electrolytic and electroless processes, cold and thermal spray coating techniques, dip and spin coating, as well as other chemical and organic coatings treatments.

                <br /> <br /> Nanobubbles Are a Promising Solution to Corrosion <br />
                Surface engineering with the thermal diffusion process is a promising technology to protect steel components from corrosion. Nanobubbles were introduced as a viable solution in the early 1990s. Since then, they have been tested for applications in a wide range of disciplines.

                <br /> <br /> Growing expectations for nanoscopic techniques to curb corrosion have emerged. Nanobubbles are an environment-friendly, simple-to-use, and inexpensive additive agent that work by acting as a coating on the steel surfaces of the pipes and equipment in the geothermal system to enhance resistance to corrosion.

                <br /> <br /> The technology is based on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) principles. It is, however, it is more versatile and cost-effective than conventional CVD. Unlike conventional CVD, this solution does not require costly or hazardous reactive gasses.

                <br /> <br /> The Future of Geothermal Energy Production <br />
                Overall, our team had a great experience at the GRC and came away with a better understanding of the current state of geothermal energy production, new technological advances, and industry challenges.


                <br /> <br /> Geothermal power is one of the most efficient and cleanest renewable energy sources available. This is because geothermal power plants produce much less greenhouse gas emissions. It also presents much fewer operational risks compared to conventional coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plants.

                <br /> <br /> There’s no doubt continued development will require innovation and collaboration across all aspects of the industry as geothermal energy production continues to gain steam. With more than 20 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity and an incredible amount of untapped energy — geothermal power is going to be a major part of the global energy mix.<p>"
